Niagarino is a very simple and lightweight data stream management system implemented in Java. Many if not most of its concepts are inspired by or based on [NiagaraST](http://datalab.cs.pdx.edu/niagara/), which is being developed by members of [Datalab](http://datalab.cs.pdx.edu/) at Portland State University. Apart from offering fewer stream operators, the main difference between NiagaraST and Niagarino lies in the fact that the latter cannot handle streams with disorder, which is one of the major strengths of NiagaraST.
